# Maverick-Sports-Websitev2
I created a vibrant, user-friendly website for a local sports club/charity using React, JSX, and Vite after consulting with them to understand their needs. The site showcases their mission with tailored content and images. I incorporated their feedback throughout, ensuring the final product met their expectations and enhanced their online presence.
