# Maverick-Sports-Websitev2
I developed a vibrant and intuitive website for a local sports club/charity group that previously had no online presence. Utilizing React, JSX, and Vite, I created a responsive site featuring clear navigation, engaging content, and carefully selected images that reflect the organisation’s mission and activities. This ensured a professional digital platform tailored to their needs.

Throughout the project, I maintained active communication with the organisation, gathering and integrating their feedback to refine the design and functionality. This collaboration not only enhanced the website’s effectiveness but also enriched my skills in client interaction, front-end development, and delivering impactful real-world solutions.
